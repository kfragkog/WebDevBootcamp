# Introduction to this Course

# Introduction to Front End Development
 - the internet: url -> IP address -> HTTP request asking for content -> the servers job is to figure out what the request wants, what to send back -> the browser gets the response back in HTML, CSS, JS and displays content
- all the logic is in the Back End, all the stuff we see and interact with is the Front End
- dynamic vs static pages eg yelp vs restaurant page
- HTML defines the structure of a webpage - the “nouns”/skeleton of a webpage - it’s mandatory
- CSS defines the style of HTML - the “adjectives”/skin of a webpage
- JS adds logic and interactivity to a webpage = the “verbs”/actions on a webpage

# Introduction to HTML
HyperText Mark up Language - it allowed to create hyper links (1990)
We tag the content: <tagName> some content </tagName>
MDN - resource for HTML, CSS, JS
Every HTML doc will start with this boilerplate - html + tab:
<!DOCTYPE html> - to define that page uses HTML5
<html> - it’s html and we then need one head and one body
<head> - metadata, everything not displayed in the browser
	<title></title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
To add comment: <!-- text --> - cmd + /
Title is important for linking to page or googling it etc
h tag is a block element (gets its own line), not inline element like strong
Ordered list has numbers, unordered has bullet points
div - way of grouping things together (like a generic container) - block level element
span - generic container, but inline

attributes - add additional info to html elements - key value pair (link html attributes in MDN) - <tag attributename = "value"></tag>

src & href - two important attributes

a (anchor) tag is how we create links to other webpages - href is the url and between > and </a> we put the text for the link

relative path - add a link to a page that is relative to the one I am at (e.g page 2.html)


# Intermediate HTML
Tables - tr table row element, td element/cell inside row, th for heading in a tr OR thead and tbody
